# Spectre
An interprocess communication method based off of Microsoft's Winsock. Unlike using files in %temp% or Namedpipes, Spectre uses nearly 0 resources (avg. 1mb-2mb) and cannot be seen to the naked eye via looking for files/pipes. It is essentially a ghost.. hence the name Spectre.

- Import all files into a C++ project.
- Read "Example.cpp" for all information.
