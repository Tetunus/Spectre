# Spectre
An interprocess communication method based off of Microsoft's Winsock.
Unlike using files in %temp% or Namedpipes, Spectre uses nearly 0 resources (avg. 1mb)
and cannot be seen to the naked eye via looking for files/pipes.

- Spectre is currently unfinished, estimated release on 6/24/2021
